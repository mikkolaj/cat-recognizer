# Binary image classifier 
Currently the classificator makes use of a 4-layer neural network with gradient descent.  
It achieves the accuracy of approx. 63% (about 72.4% of cats 54.2% of non-cats are labeled correctly).  
To make a prediction on a single image install libraries from requirements.txt and run predict.py.  
# Future plans:  
- Transform the model into a CNN
